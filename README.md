This back end API keeps track of items in the database for the front end of this application.  It is hosted by Heroku and you can find the link to the Heroky API in the description of this repository.

## Planning Story

For this project I decieded to build a personal library that a user can use to keep track of the books that they have read.  I used express to handle the incomming data and mongoose and a mongoDB database to store the data that has been sent to this API.  You can read about the front end of this project at the link above.

### Technologies Used
-   Express
-   Mongoose
-   MongoDB


### Unsolved Problems

-   Would like to eventually enable comments on books so that a User can see what they thought of the book.
-   I would like to make the background more appealing to the user
-   I would like to incorperate bootstraps modals to give the site better UI
